# BSafe_WIE-HACK
Wearable women safety device.
Our aim is to develop an affordable wearable safety device (which is
hidden from the predator) supported by an app which sends a message
with the person’s location to the safety contacts and starts a loud
alarm noise when it senses an attempt of sexual harassment on the
victim. This system can also be connected to additional accessories like
a pendant which could be used as a onetime pepper spray which will
be triggered at the time of the incident to prevent the mishap like rape,
kidnapping etc.
The wearable device can be attached to the bra and worn over it, if a
predator tries to grope the lady the sensors in the bra trigger the
messages, alarm, pepper spray etc.
USP of our product:


• The predator is unaware that the person is wearing a safety
device, so he cannot plan to escape the safety features in
advance.

• The product will be comfortable to wear and cause no discomfort
to the person wearing the device.

• Even when the lady is unable to respond due to the panic
situation, she can be helped.

• Cost effective
